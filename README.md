Speech to Nest: 

Input client audio command, convert to speech with Google Web Speech 
API. Send text to Scriptr which uses Wit.AI to understand intent and 
keywords and then use the Nest API to change the temperature.

Watson Text to Speech API is used to vocalize temperature changes and 
output to the user.
